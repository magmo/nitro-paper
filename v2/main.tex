\begin{abstract}
  Virtual state channels allow peers to bootstrap existing connections to form a state channel network. Existing virtual channel constructions are not so good. We present an amalgamation of two existing state channel protocols, Nitro and Perun, which considerately improve the practical application of virtual state channels..
