% There are many examples of state channels and off-chain scaling projects. In this section we limit ourselves to a review of published work on the subject of off-chain payment and state channel networks.

% The Lightning network \cite{lightning}, which went live in March 2018, provides off-chain payments for the Bitcoin blockchain.
% The payments make use of hashed timelocked contracts (HTLCs), which can be thought of as payments that are conditional on a hash pre-image being revealed before a given point in time.
% This construction allows payments to be routed through an arbitrary number of intermediaries but is strictly limited to payments.
% The Raiden network \cite{raiden} provides the same functionality for the Ethereum blockchain and launched on the mainnet in December 2018.

% Celer Network \cite{celer} proposes a state channel construction that extends HTLCs to allow payments that are conditional on the outcome of an arbitrary calculation.
% The outcome of the calculation can specify the amount of funds that move, as well as whether the payments should go through at all.
% The paper gives a high-level justification of how the construction yields state channels capable of running arbitrary state machine transitions.

% Perun \cite{perun1, perun2} proposed a different flavour of state channel construction, viewing state channels as a direct interaction between two parties instead of a series of conditional payments.
% This makes it very clear that state channel updates themselves need only be shared between the participants in the channel, and do not need to be routed through a network.
% The authors specify a virtual channel construction, allowing two-party channels to be supported through intermediaries, and prove its correctness using the UC framework.
% The proof relies on the fact that their virtual channels have a pre-determined validity time, after which the channel must be settled.

% Counterfactual \cite{counterfactual} gives a state channel construction using the technique of counterfactual instantiation, a form of logic that reasons about constructions that could be deployed to the chain if required.
% The channels they describe are $n$-party and they give a high-level overview of how to construct `meta-channels' that allow channels to be supported through intermediaries.
% While the paper itself does not specify the details of how to construct meta-channels, many of these details can be found in their publicly released source code.
